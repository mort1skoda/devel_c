Composite Overlay Window
           Version 0.3 of the protocol adds the Composite Overlay Window, which provides compositing managers with a surface on which to draw without interference. This
           window is always above normal windows and is always below the screen saver window. It is an InputOutput window whose width and height are the screen dimensions.
           Its visual is the root visual and its border width is zero. Attempts to redirect it using the composite extension are ignored. This window does not appear in
           the reply of the QueryTree request. It is also an override redirect window. These last two features make it invisible to window managers and other X11 clients.
           The only way to access the XID of this window is via the CompositeGetOverlayWindow request. Initially, the Composite Overlay Window is unmapped.
